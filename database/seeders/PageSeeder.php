            <p>Founded in 2024, Family Cloud emerged from the recognition that families needed a better way to share and preserve their digital memories. Unlike social media platforms where your content becomes public and subject to algorithms, we provide a private sanctuary for your family\'s most important moments.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe that family memories deserve the highest level of protection and the easiest sharing experience. Our mission is to provide families with a secure, intuitive platform that brings loved ones closer together through shared experiences and preserved memories.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
            <p>Privacy is not just a feature for usâ€”it\'s our foundation. Every photo, video, and document you share is encrypted and stored securely. We don\'t sell your data, show advertisements, or use your content for any purpose other than helping your family stay connected.</p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Your family\'s content remains private and secure</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to use for all family members, regardless of technical expertise</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Your memories are safe with our robust backup and security systems</li>
                <li><strong>Family Focused:</strong> Every feature is designed with families in mind</li>
